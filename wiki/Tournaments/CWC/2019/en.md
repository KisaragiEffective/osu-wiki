2. Map scoring will use Score V2.
3. The maps for each round will be announced by the mapset selectors in advance on the Sunday before the actual matches take place. Only these will be used during the respective matches.
   - There will be a [Hidden](/wiki/Game_Modifiers), [HardRock](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) and a [DoubleTime](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) bracket.
   - One map will be given as a tiebreaker map. This map will only be played in case of a tie.
4. Match schedule will be settled by the Tournament Management (see below).
5. If no staff or referee is available, the match will be postponed.
6. Failed players' scores do not get added to the team score.
   - Reviving and surviving during a map is considered as passing it.
7. Use of the Visual Settings to alter background dim or disable map elements like storyboards and skins are allowed.
8. If the beatmap ends in a draw, the game will be nullified.
9. If a player disconnects, they get treated as if they failed the map.
   - Disconnects within 30 seconds after map begin can be rematched. This is up to the referee's discretion. The played beatmap might be aborted for this.
